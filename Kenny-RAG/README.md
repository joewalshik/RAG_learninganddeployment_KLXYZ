# 🧠 Local RAG Chat App

This is a lightweight, local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, and Ollama.

It allows users to upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` documents and ask natural language questions based on their contents — **without relying on external APIs or cloud services**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Local-only: No internet connection or OpenAI key required
- ✅ Supports TXT, PDF, and Word documents
- ✅ Powered by Ollama (e.g. Mistral or LLaMA2 running locally)
- ✅ Conversational memory — follow-up questions are supported
- ✅ Easy to use Streamlit interface
- ✅ Document upload optional — app still accepts general questions
